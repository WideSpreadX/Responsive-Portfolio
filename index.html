                <p> Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Jonathan Olson. I grew up in Cromwell, CT, which was a
                    smaller town before everyone found out about it. I was really big into sports, I actually got
                    batting MVP in an international tournament in Dominican Republic. I also played Soccer, Basketball
                    and Football. For fun I would ride quads and dirtbikes, go hiking, and of course some video games
                    here and there.</p>
                <br>
                <p> My education was through private schools consisting of The Independent Day School (K-8) and Xavier
                    High School. I love math and science. I love technology. I won the "Invention Convention" in the 3rd
                    grade, for a fire safety mechanism that would alert and extinguish a fire on your christmas tree
                    (back when christmas lighting always caught on fire). I am currently attending a tech bootcamp for
                    Web Development.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Don't get me started with work...because I won't stop. Not sure what it is, but I can't get enough
                    it. Meaningful work at least. I do everything in my power to help someone. I think my favorite trait
                    about me is, I don't stop.</p>
